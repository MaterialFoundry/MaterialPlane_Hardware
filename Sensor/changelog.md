# Changelog Material Plane Sensor Firmware

### Firmware v2.1.6 - 02-08-2022
<ul>
    <li>Fixed issue with DIY hardware which became imcompatible with the last module version.</li>
</ul>

### Firmware v2.1.5 - 08-06-2022
<ul>
    <li>Added OTA update capability</li>
    <li>A different webserver library is used, which is faster and works on more browsers</li>
    <li>Sensor now properly transmits that no bases have been detected</li>
    <li>Added a 'Drop Delay' setting to filter out short periods of time where the sensor cannot see a base</li>
</ul>

### Webserver v1.0.3 - 08-06-2022
<ul>
    <li>Added OTA update capability</li>
    <li>Displayed points in the IR Tracker tab are now colored and numbered</li>
    <li>Updated the formatting of the IR Tracker tab</li>
</ul>

### Firmware v2.1.4 - 28-02-2022
<ul>
    <li>(Beta HW only) Due to a design error, completely draining the battery can brick the sensor. Some code has been added that puts the sensor in hibernation mode if the battery voltage is too low, reducing the chance of draining the battery. The sensor will wake up every 10 minutes to check if the battery voltage is high enough.</li>
</ul>

### Firmware v2.1.3 - 26-01-2022
Fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Sensor would not connect to wifi if the password was of specific lengths (16 characters did not work, possibly other lengths as well). This has been fixed</li>
    <li>Fixed some minor instability issues</li>
</ul>

Additions:
<ul>
    <li>Multi-point and offset calibration are again implemented. Check the wiki for more info on how to use this: https://github.com/CDeenen/MaterialPlane/wiki/Beta-Hardware-Guide#sensor-calibration</li>
    <li>Auto exposure now works for diy HW</li>
    <li>Added option to invert the LEDs for the full DIY HW (required if using common anode LEDs)</li>
</ul>

Other:
<ul>
    <li>FreeRTOS is now used to allow parallel processing. This should result in improved performance and stability</li>
    <li>Big code cleanup and restructuring</li>
</ul>

### Webserver v1.0.1 - 26-01-2022
Fixes:
<ul>
    <li>The 'Coordinates' window would not always display the correct coordinates</li>
    <li>Fixed some typos</li>
</ul>

Additions:
<ul>
    <li>Added a confirmation dialog for the 'Reset' button, so the user doesn't accidentally reset all sensor settings</li>
</ul>

Other:
<ul>
    <li>When the websocket connection has been established, the Material Foundry logo has been removed, since it can take up quite a lot of real estate on a display</li>
    <li>When the webserver loses the websocket connection, it now indicates this by displaying a 'reconnecting' screen</li>
    <li>Removed the 'Area Filter' section, since this is not used</li>
</ul>

### v2.1.2 - 09-11-2021
Fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Messed up something in the last update that greatly reduced the sensitivity of the ID sensor, this should be fixed now</li>
</ul>

### v2.1.1 - 05-11-2021
Fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Fixed a problem with the IR32 library that resulted in compilation errors</li>
    <li>Improved battery voltage calculation on beta hardware</li>
</ul>

Other:
<ul>
    <li>On boot, LEDs switch on earlier, instead of waiting for WiFi to connect, so you get faster feedback about the sensor being on</li>
    <li>Made charging led fade smoother</li>
</ul>

### v2.1.0 - 12-10-2021
Additions:
<ul>
    <li>Added auto exposure procedure (beta hw only)</li>
    <li>Added a device name (DNS name), which allows the user to configure a name, and connect to the sensor through "[name].local" ("materialsensor.local", by default)</li>
    <li>The sensor now hosts a webserver that allows sensor configuration accessible through "[name].local" ("materialsensor.local", by default). This can be accessed through any web browser. <b>Please check the documentation on github on how to upload the webserver data to the sensor</b></li>
    <li>If the sensor cannot connect to an access point, it will create its own. This allows users to set up the sensor through a web browser, instead of using the serial port. Access point name is "[name]" ("materialsensor", by default). It redirects all traffic to its configuration page, so to access it, the user can try to connect to any website</li>
    <li>When charging the battery, the charge indicator now fades instead of blinking</li>
</ul>

Fixes:
<ul>
    <li>Rotation now works</li>
    <li>Rotation is now performed before mirroring, so the correct axis is mirrored</li>
    <li>Websocket server will now start whenever WiFi is connected, not only at boot</li>
</ul>

Other:
<ul>
    <li>Battery percentage calculation has been moved to the sensor and has been made more accurate (it's still a rough estimate, though)</li>
    <li>Minor changes to the communication protocol between sensor and module</li>
</ul>

### v2.0.1 - 16-07-2021
Fixes:
<ul>
    <li>When no bases are found, sensor now sends correct command to drop the token</li>
    <li>Fixed issue where sensor would stay in calibration mode if calibration was not successfully completed</li>
</ul>

### v2.0.0 - 15-07-2021
Initial release of v2
